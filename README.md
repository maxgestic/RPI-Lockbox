# RPI-Lockbox
This is my Mini IoT project for my 4th year in my Ethical Hacking course. The idea is to have a lockbox with a electomagnetic lock and a fingerprint scanner that has a remote control webapp hosted on AWS as well as a web app hosted locally on the RPI to add/remove fingerprints. The scanner will be in recognition mode while the device is powered on and if a registered fingerprint is recognised will open the lock, if the user uses the web app to add a fingerprint the application will stop the recognitition mode and perform that action before going back into recognition mode.
